;; The deterministic fitness function for query cost -- the judge in a
;; co-scientist loop over this repo's read path, in the role
;; `design-quality.audit` plays for UI (root ADR-2606141500 / isekai ADR-0007:
;; the loop is only real if the judge measures something).
;;
;;   nbb --classpath "<server/src>:<deps>" scripts/audit_query_cost.cljs
;;
;; ## What it measures, and why not milliseconds
;;
;; COUNTS: block reads (`get-fn` calls), scans issued at the source, and quads
;; the engine actually touched. ADR-2608021000 settled this workspace on counts
;; because this workstation runs many concurrent agent sessions and a
;; wall-clock number here is a number about the host.
;;
;; ## The floor is what makes a number a finding
;;
;; Every shape declares the work an ideal plan would do -- `:floor-asks`, the
;; number of index probes an ideal plan needs. For an n-clause conjunction that
;; is n: read each clause's relation once and join in memory. Headroom is
;; measured-minus-floor.
;;
;; It was `:floor-quads` first, and that was the wrong fitness. Quads asked for
;; is dominated by the per-request scan cache `source-for` installs, so the
;; recursive rules looked like the whole problem (75 quads asked against a
;; 3-row answer) when the cache was already absorbing them down to 2 physical
;; scans. Counting ASKS instead moved the entire headroom onto the joins, which
;; is where it actually is -- and that is a finding about the FITNESS FUNCTION,
;; recorded because a co-scientist loop is only as honest as its judge.
