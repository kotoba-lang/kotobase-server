;; COUNTS, not milliseconds: this workstation runs many concurrent agent
;; sessions and a wall-clock number here would be about the host
;; (ADR-2608021000 settled the same question the same way). `same=` is
;; printed on every row because a read count is only interesting if both
;; paths answered the same question -- a path that reads less by answering
;; less is not faster.
