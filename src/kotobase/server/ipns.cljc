(ns kotobase.server.ipns
  "Pure decision logic for `com.etzhayyim.apps.kotoba.ipns.{head,publish}`
  (ADR-2607061800) -- UNAUTHENTICATED reads, signature-gated writes.
  Authority is the record's own Ed25519 signature (`kotobase.ipns/verify-
  head`, from `kotoba-lang/kotobase-client`), not a CACAO -- a genuinely
  different trust model from `kotobase.server.handler`'s `datomic.transact`
  surface, kept as its own namespace rather than another `handle` case.

  Deliberately does NOT read or write storage itself (unlike
  `kotobase.server.handler`'s `do-*` fns, which own their storage calls) --
  `verify-and-decide-publish` takes the CURRENT record (already fetched by
  the caller) as a plain argument and returns a pure decision. This keeps
  the actual read + conditional-write orchestration (R2's onlyIf, B2's
  equivalent, ...) entirely the caller's concern, matching how
  `do-transact`'s own head CAS is caller-orchestrated too.

  Extracted 2026-07-07 from `kotoba-lang/kotobase-cljc-worker`'s
  `worker.cljc` (`run-ipns-head`/`run-ipns-publish`), generalized away from
  R2 + js/Response construction.

  KNOWN LEXICON GAP, inherited unchanged (owner-confirmed in the source
  this was extracted from, not fixed here): records are keyed by the signed
  record's own `:name` field; a `graph` query param implying a graph-CID ->
  IPNS-name derivation is documented elsewhere but not implemented anywhere
  in this stack -- a separate, tracked follow-up."
