  "CYPHER BASIC SUBSET -> the same map-form Datalog `do-q` executes
  (ADR-2607172500's `graph.query` surface; ADR-2607250100 axis 4).
  Sibling of `kotobase.server.sparql`, same doctrine: every unsupported
  form is rejected loudly with the supported grammar in the error, never
  silently misread.

  Supported, and ONLY this:

    MATCH p1, p2, ...
    [OPTIONAL MATCH p1, p2, ...] ...
    [WHERE v.attr = lit AND v.attr = lit ...]
    RETURN [DISTINCT] item, ...
    [ORDER BY item [ASC|DESC], ...] [LIMIT n]

    pattern := (v [:Label]* [{attr: lit, ...}]) chained by relationships
    rel     := -[[relvar] :attr [*range]]->   left to right
             | <-[[relvar] :attr [*range]]-   right to left
             | -[[relvar] :attr [*range]]-    undirected
    range   := * | *n | *n.. | *n..m | *..m   (bare * is 1.., UNBOUNDED)
    item    := v | v.attr [AS alias] | agg(v) [AS alias]
             | coalesce(item, ...) [AS alias]
             | toInteger(item) [AS alias]
    lit     := \"string\" | 'string' | integer | decimal | $param

  Attribute names are used as stored: a rel type `[:sp/knows]` matches the
  stored attribute string \":sp/knows\"; a property key `sp/name:` is
  prefixed to \":sp/name\" (the write path stores every attribute as its
  keyword-string form). A node label `(n:Person)` matches the stored
  attribute \":label\". A bare `(v)` with no properties, label or
  relationship binds nothing and is rejected (never an implicit scan).

  A `$param` with no value in the params map is a failure, not an empty
  match. `v.attr` projections compile to OPTIONAL blocks, so an absent
  property is null as Cypher requires, not a dropped row.

  Anything other than a plain single-hop left-to-right relationship
  compiles to a `:paths` entry rather than a triple, and needs an
  executor that implements it -- `query-exec/execute` refuses a compiled
  query carrying a construct it cannot evaluate rather than approximating
  it.

  OPTIONAL MATCH supports ordinary directed fixed-hop BGPs. Variable-length or
  undirected relationships inside OPTIONAL are rejected; both are supported in
  the primary MATCH. Anonymous nodes are accepted when the surrounding pattern
  binds the query.

  Not supported (rejected): WITH, CASE and functions other than coalesce and
  toInteger, WHERE operators other than `=` `<>` `<` `<=` `>` `>=` joined by
  AND, OR/NOT, OPTIONAL variable-length/undirected relationships, SKIP, and
  every write form (CREATE/MERGE/DELETE/SET -- this surface is read-only)."
