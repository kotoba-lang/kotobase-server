  "`graph.sparql` answered by the SPARQL 1.1 Protocol implementation
  (`kotoba-lang/org-w3-sparql-protocol` + `kotoba-lang/sparql`'s algebra)
  over a `kotobase.server.pattern-source` — index reads, not a hydrate.

  This is the implementation `handler/do-sparql` calls after the snapshot
  equivalence suite proved the former hydrated subset and this index-backed
  path agreed across the supported grammar (ADR-2608039970,
  ADR-2608039975).

  ## Why two implementations answer differently unless you are careful

  The old subset compiles a query into the map-form Datalog `do-q` executes
  and runs it over a fully hydrated `hot-db`. This one parses the same text
  into `kotoba-lang/sparql`'s algebra and runs it over the quads the query's
  own patterns read. Three things have to line up, and each has already
  bitten once:

  - **IRI spelling.** `<:sp/name>` is what every existing caller writes; the
    protocol repo's own scheme is `urn:kotobase:`. Reconciled upstream
    (org-w3-sparql-protocol#8) — a bare `<:attr>` is shorthand now, so one
    attribute has one term whichever spelling was used.
  - **Value representation.** `pattern-source` decodes `v_edn` one level, so
    a quad's object is the value the write path STORED — and the write path
    stringifies, so `:sp/age 30` is the string `\"30\"`. Query literals are
    coerced with `str` to meet it, which is the same pre-coercion the old
    subset does at compile time, and projection returns the value as-is —
    that is what `{:rows [[\"e1\" \"30\"]]}` has always meant.
  - **`visible?` shape.** `pattern-source` takes the ROW-shaped predicate
    (`{:e :a :v_edn :added}`) that `hot-datoms` forwards; `source->quads`
    takes the `{:s :p :o}` one. Filtering happens once, at the row level,
    which is why `(constantly true)` is passed to the second — the rows a
    viewer may not see never became quads."

  "A query literal -> the form the datom plane stores.

  Rows carry `v_edn`, so `quads/source->quads` builds object terms whose

  characters `\"alice\"` INCLUDING its quotes. The parser builds literals
  from query text as real values. BGP matching is plain `=` on terms, so
  without this every literal comparison silently answers nothing —
  measured: `SELECT ?e WHERE { ?e <:sp/name> \"alice\" }` returned 0 rows
  against the subset's 1.

  This is the same pre-coercion `kotobase.server.sparql` does at compile
  time (\"literals pre-coerced to the write path's stored-string
  representation\"). It belongs to the SOURCE, not the parser: the
  materialize-backed path stores real values and needs no coercion at all,
  which is why this lives here rather than upstream."
