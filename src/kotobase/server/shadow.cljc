  "Failure-isolated shadow routing for engine migrations.

  This namespace knows nothing about kotobase-peer or IEngine. A deployment
  injects two handlers with the same wire contract. Primary always owns the
  response; shadow work is scheduled for comparison and can never change a
  successful primary result. This keeps XRPC translation outside either
  storage engine and lets a Worker pass the task to `waitUntil`."
