  "Shared execution layer for the SPARQL/Cypher compiled-query shape
  (ADR-2607250100 axis 4 depth pass). A compiled query is:

    {:find      [?v ... | {:agg :count :var ?x :as ?c} ...]
     :where     [[s p o] ...]          ;; base BGP -> engine query
     :unions    [[[s p o] ...] ...]    ;; alternative BGPs -> solution union
     :optionals [[[s p o] ...] ...]    ;; OPTIONAL blocks -> LEFT JOIN
     :filters   [{:var ?v :op :< :value \"10\"} ...]
     :group-by  [?v ...]
     :order-by  [{:var ?v :dir :asc|:desc} ...]
     :limit     n}

  Either :where or :unions supplies the base solutions -- :unions is the
  bag union (SPARQL default semantics: duplicates kept) of each branch's
  solutions, with variables absent from a branch nil-filled.

  PUSH-DOWN (2026-07-25): constructs the engine (arrangement.datalog)
  can evaluate NATIVELY are compiled into the single engine query instead
  of run as a post-pass -- closing part of the maturity-bar axis-1
  \"engine push-down\" gap. Pushable, and only when NO OPTIONAL is
  present (OPTIONAL adds bindings the engine query doesn't see):
    - COUNT / COUNT-DISTINCT aggregates -> engine `:find (count ?v)` with
      GROUP BY = the bare find vars (engine computes the count during the
      join; the handler never materializes the full row set);
    - `=` / `!=` FILTER -> engine `[(= ?v lit)]` / `[(not= ?v lit)]`
      predicate clauses (string equality, safe on wire-string values).
  What STAYS a post-pass, with reason: OPTIONAL (engine has no left join),
  numeric FILTER `< <= > >=` and SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX (engine's `<`/`+` need
  numbers; values are wire strings the engine can't coerce), UNION
  (multi-clause or-join branch support not relied on here), ORDER BY
  (engine returns a set). The pushable path and the post-pass path are
  asserted to agree by the same test suite (identical results either way)."
