  "Whether a query may run, decided from its READ PLAN, before a block is
  fetched.

  ## The thing being refused

  `kotobase.server.datom-plan` maps `[s p o]` onto an index and a prefix.
  Two of its six rows bind no prefix at all:

      [_ _ o]  -> :eavt []   -- `:vaet` covers ref-valued attrs, not literals
      [_ _ _]  -> :eavt []   -- full scan, as asked

  Those are the whole graph, filtered afterwards in memory. The cost follows
  the DATABASE and not the answer, which is the same shape as
  `kotobase.query.bridge/materialize` — measured 2026-08-23 as linear in the
  documents while the query itself stayed near 1ms across a 64x range
  (`com-junkawasaki/root` 90-docs/kotobase-performance/2026-08-23-*). This
  namespace is how a query carrying one of those stops being executable.

  A rule body counts. `owl.rules/triple-rules`' base case is literally
  `[?s ?p ?o]`, so a ruleset can smuggle a full scan into a query whose own
  `:where` is perfectly bounded — and it is worse there than in a `:where`,
  because a fixpoint re-asks its clauses every round.

  ## Deny by default, and that is the whole point

  `admit` refuses a clause shape it does not recognise (`:unrecognised-clause`)
  rather than passing it. A gate whose unknown case is `allow` reports the
  same verdict for `I checked and it is bounded` and `I could not tell`, and
  those are the two answers that must never look alike — this repository has
  a receipt for exactly that failure in its own deploy script
  (`deploy-versioned.mjs`, an unreadable provenance answer returning the same
  `false` as a mismatched one).

  Clause shapes that provably issue no read — predicate/function clauses
  (`[(> ?n 18)]`) and rule invocations (`(owl-type ?i ?c)`, which names no
  attribute) — are admitted as reading nothing, not as unrecognised.

  ## What it cannot decide statically, and what covers that

  A bound predicate says the read is a RANGE, not that the range is small:
  `[?e :rdf/type ?c]` is one index range and may still be most of the graph.
  Nothing in a plan can tell. `over-budget` is the second half, applied to
  what a prefetch actually returned — after the read, before the query runs,
  so a fixpoint over an enormous source is stopped even though its first read
  was already paid. That asymmetry is stated rather than papered over: this
  bounds MEMORY AND EXECUTION, and bounds the first read only in so far as
  the plan is unbounded on its face.

  ## The refusal reports a cardinality, and that is measured

  `over-budget`'s `:detail` names `n` -- the size of the prefetched union,
  counted in `pattern-source` before any visibility decision exists -- and
  `refusal-response` puts it on the wire in both `:details` and `:refusals`.
  So a caller who can read no value of a graph still learns an exact count
  of it, whenever their bounded patterns select more than the cap.

  This is bounded in a way the library seam underneath is not, and the
  difference is the whole reason to write it down. `kotobase.query.bridge/
  materialize` takes `max-datoms` as an ARGUMENT, so a caller there
  binary-searches an exact total in about a dozen probes
  (`kotoba-lang/ayatori` `bench/inference-channel-01.edn`). Here the policy
  is a literal in this file, every call site takes the 1-arity, and neither
  policy key appears anywhere else -- so the disclosure is one number, only
  for ranges already past the cap, with no way to probe below it.

  Measured by `scripts/measure_wire_disclosure.cljs`, both directions:
  removing `n` from the detail fails three assertions, flipping `>` to `>=`
  fails the boundary one ALONE, and setting `allow-unbounded-patterns?` true
  makes the harness refuse to report at all. Nothing here proposes changing
  the message. A refusal that will not say why is its own defect, and which
  of the two costs to pay is a decision, not a bug.

  Pure: no store, no I/O, no platform split."

  loudly rather than to tune anything, and it is a NUMBER so that raising it
