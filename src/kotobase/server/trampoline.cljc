  "Bridge an ASYNC block store (any `fetch1: cid -> Promise<bytes>`) to
  kotobase-peer's SYNCHRONOUS block reader contract (`(get-fn cid) -> bytes`).
  Storage-agnostic by construction -- works identically over Cloudflare R2,
  Backblaze B2, IndexedDB, or anything else that can answer \"give me the
  bytes at this CID\" asynchronously; the concrete `fetch1` is entirely the
  caller's concern.

  `cold-datoms`/`hydrate-db`/`commit!` walk a prolly-tree (or, for `commit!`,
  just the chain head) through that sync get-fn, but any real storage
  backend is async. `with-blocks` runs the sync computation against an
  in-memory block cache and, on a cache miss, fetches the block via `fetch1`
  and retries -- a block-miss trampoline. Correct for any tree shape;
  efficient once the read touches few blocks (prolly-tree prefix pruning
  bounds this for a filtered read, so this stays cheap even as a graph
  grows -- unlike a full-prefix warm)."

(defn missing-block
  "Signal thrown by the sync get-fn on a cache miss; caught by `with-blocks`.
  The `:block-miss` marker lets a caller's error handler re-throw it (rather
  than swallow it as a generic failure) so the trampoline actually sees the
  miss -- see `block-miss?`."

(defn ex-data-chain
  "`ex-data` of `e` and of every cause beneath it, outermost first.

  Exists because a runtime may WRAP a thrown ex-info rather than rethrow it:
  nbb/SCI, when the throw crosses an async continuation, produces its own
  error whose `ex-data` is `{:type :sci/error ...}` and puts the original
  under `:cause`. Any classifier that reads a marker out of `(ex-data e)`
  ONCE therefore stops seeing that marker on that runtime -- and, because the
  marker is what selects the specific outcome, the failure is silent: the
  request degrades to a generic error, or a retryable miss stops being
  retried. Read the chain, not the outermost link.

  Bounded (9 links) so a self-referential cause cannot hang a request. On the
  JVM and under shadow-cljs the chain is one link long, so classifiers keep
  the behaviour they already had."

  Searches the cause chain (see `ex-data-chain`). Every reader of the payload
  goes through here: `with-blocks` reading `(ex-data e)` inline is what made
  the trampoline itself blind to the signal, while `block-miss?` -- the
  documented predicate directly below it -- would have seen it."

  `with-blocks`-driven computation in its OWN try/catch (e.g. to turn engine

  instead of swallowing it -- otherwise the trampoline never sees the miss

  fetching absent blocks via `(fetch1 cid) -> Promise<bytes>` and retrying.
  Returns a Promise of `f`'s result. `f` must be pure/idempotent (it is
  re-run per miss, from scratch).

  `f` may return a plain value OR a js/Promise (kotobase-peer's crypto seam,
  ADR-2607051000, makes engine calls Promise-returning on cljs) -- a
  block-miss can therefore surface either as a SYNC throw from `f` or as a
  REJECTION of `f`'s promise (sync-get called inside a `.then`
  continuation), and both trampoline the same way. Non-miss failures reject
