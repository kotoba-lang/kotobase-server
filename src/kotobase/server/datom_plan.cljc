(ns kotobase.server.datom-plan
  "How an in-process `[s p o]` pattern becomes a Datomic-API index read.

  This server-owned copy deliberately separates the storage/query contract
  from `kotobase-client`. The client now also owns IPNS name-binding security;
  forcing a graph-head runtime to upgrade that unrelated contract merely to
  obtain an index plan invalidates its existing graph-CID-named signatures.
  Golden pattern-source tests keep this small pure table aligned with the HTTP
  client's transport plan.

  Not `kotobase.datom-source.plan`, which is what it was called first: in
  ClojureScript a namespace cannot be both a leaf and a branch. Defining
  `kotobase.datom-source` as a Closure module object clobbers the
  `.plan` property the child namespace installs on it, and every call
  through it fails at RUNTIME with `plan.reads is not a function` while the
  build stays green. Measured here before this file was renamed.

  This namespace is `.cljc` because `kotobase-server` calls `hot-datoms`
  directly and runs its tests on the JVM; the HTTP transport remains in the
  client repository.

  ## The table

  | pattern   | index   | components | note |
  |-----------|---------|------------|------|
  | `[s _ _]` | `:eavt` | `[s]`      | entity prefix |
  | `[s p _]` | `:eavt` | `[s p]`    | |
  | `[_ p o]` | `:avet` | `[p o]`    | the selective one |
  | `[_ p _]` | `:aevt` | `[p]`      | |
  | `[_ _ o]` | `:eavt` | `[]`       | **no index** — see below |
  | `[_ _ _]` | `:eavt` | `[]`       | full scan, as asked |

  **`[_ _ o]` has no index and this namespace does not pretend otherwise.**
  `:vaet` covers only ref-valued attributes in Datomic's model, so a literal
  object is not reachable through it; the read degrades to a full `:eavt`
  scan with an in-memory filter. `datalog.query` makes exactly the same call
  in the same words — a correct answer at O(database) beats a fast wrong one,
  and `:post-filter` is RETURNED rather than applied so a caller can see what
  the pushdown did not cover."

(defn reads
  "`patterns` -> the distinct `{:index :components}` reads they need.

  Deduplicated because two patterns of one query routinely plan to the same
  read: they differ only in a position that index's prefix cannot bind, and
  issuing it twice is two round trips for one answer."

(defn rows->quads
  "Rows -> asserted `{:s :p :o}` quads. `row-fn` reads one row into
  `{:e :a :v_edn :added}` — JS interop over an XRPC response, plain map
  access in-process.

  Retractions are dropped, so a scan answers what is currently asserted.
  The object stays the EDN wire string the row carries: decoding here would
  have to be undone by every caller that compares against a literal parsed
  out of a query string."
