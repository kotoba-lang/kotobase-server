(ns kotobase.server.security.credential
  "Which credential a request is presenting — decided by what it names, never
  by trying one and then the other.

  Two delegation wires now reach this server: CACAO chains (live) and
  biscuits (root ADR-2608180200). The question of how they coexist has one
  answer that is safe and several that look reasonable, so it is written here
  as a pure function with the reasoning attached rather than as an `or` in a
  request handler.

  ## Trying credentials in turn is a downgrade oracle

  The natural shape is *verify the biscuit; if that fails, verify the CACAO*.
  It is wrong in both orders. A caller who can present both gets the union of
  what either would confer, and an attacker who can influence one of them
  gets to pick which check the request is decided by — including picking the
  weaker one. **A request must name its wire, and exactly one.**

  ## A failed verification is a denial, never a reason to try something else

  This follows from the same argument but is worth stating separately,
  because the tempting implementation is a `cond` that falls through. Failure
  here means *this credential did not verify*, and there is no interpretation
  of that which makes another credential more trustworthy.

  ## Both present is refused, not resolved

  Preferring one silently makes the other decorative: a caller believes they
  attenuated with a biscuit while a CACAO decided the request. The ambiguity
  is the bug, so it is reported as one — `:ambiguous-credential`.

  ## Rollout is an allowlist, and off is the default

  `:biscuit-enabled-graphs` gates the new wire per graph. An absent set means
  no graph, not every graph: a flag that fails open would make enabling a
  wire the consequence of forgetting to configure it."
