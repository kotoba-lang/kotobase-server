;; ── biscuit delegation (root ADR-2608180200) ─────────────────────────────────
;;
;; The same answer `verify-chain` gives, from the wire this fleet has chosen as
;; its delegation centre. Both paths land on `:effective-caps`, which is the
;; only thing the handler downstream reads, so this is additive: no route
;; changes and the CACAO path is untouched.
;;
;; The difference that matters is above, not here: a CACAO chain is verified
;; with `ed25519.verify` against issuer DIDs the server must know, while a
;; biscuit is verified against ONE root public key. Every attenuation after
;; that root is checked by the token's own key chain, so an edge can decide a
;; call holding nothing secret — which is why the centre is biscuit and not a
;; bearer format (root ADR-2608180200, `macaroon`'s README for the contrast).
