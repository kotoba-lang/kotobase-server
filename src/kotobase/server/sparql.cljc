(ns kotobase.server.sparql
  "SPARQL SUBSET -> the compiled-query shape `kotobase.server.query-exec`
  executes over the map-form Datalog engine (ADR-2607172500's
  `graph.sparql` surface; ADR-2607250100 axis 4, depth pass 2026-07-25).

  Supported, and ONLY this -- an HONEST SUBSET (each unsupported form is
  rejected loudly with the supported grammar in the error, never silently
  misread):

    SELECT ?v ... | SELECT * | SELECT (COUNT(?x) AS ?c) [?v ...]
      aggregates: COUNT | SUM | MIN | MAX | AVG
    WHERE { t . t
            OPTIONAL { t . t }        (left outer join)
            FILTER(?v op lit) }       (op: = != < <= > >=)
    GROUP BY ?v ...
    LIMIT n

    term := ?var | <iri> | \"string\" | 'string' | integer | decimal

  When aggregates are present, every bare SELECT variable must appear in
  GROUP BY (no silent first-of-group). Numeric FILTER comparison applies
  when both sides parse as numbers; lexicographic otherwise -- values are
  stored as wire strings (`tx-edn->quads` stringification), and <iri>/
  quoted/number literals compile to that stored-string form.

  Not supported (rejected): PREFIX/BASE, UNION, GRAPH, ORDER BY,
  DISTINCT, HAVING, property paths, blank nodes, language tags, ^^typed
  literals, subqueries, BIND, VALUES, CONSTRUCT/ASK/DESCRIBE, nested
  OPTIONAL, expressions beyond a single `?var op literal` in FILTER."
